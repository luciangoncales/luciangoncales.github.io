      <description>Model composition plays a key role in many Software Engineering activities, for example, in the evolution of software models to add new features. Given the context, many techniques for composition of software models have arisen to support the integration of design models, enhance the maintainability of software artifacts, and minimize the effort invested by developers.
However, some problems are critical to the proper functioning and evaluation of the effectiveness of modeling techniques, such as: (i) how model composition assessment strategies are rigid and imprecise; (ii) the techniques do not guarantee the absence of inconsistencies and do not detect the side effects of such inconsistencies in the models; and (iii) the techniques do not guarantee the effectiveness of the compositions.</description>
